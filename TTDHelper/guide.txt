--> At the bottom you have your Start Button. If you have choosen an excercise, it will be started by clicking on this Button

--> If you are still working at an excercise you have another Button. The "Back Button". If you click on it you can go one phase back. But carefully, if you go back, the code of the current phase is then cleared.


#Start An Excercise

--> Red Phase
After you started an excercise you go into the red phase. There you have to write a failing test. We loaded a scaffolding for you, so you only have to write your code into the loaded method.
If you're ready click on "Go To Next Phase". Whether the phase changes you see to the left. 

--> Green Phase
In the green phase you write a method , which is to meet the previous test.

--> Refactor Phase
In the refactor phase you can revise  your code. If you're  ready click on "Go To Next Phase".


#Particularities

--> If Timetrack is on, then you get a Window with a LineChart of your times per phase.
